======================================
Welcome to RAD-Gen's Documentation
======================================

RAD-Gen is a tool for silicon area/timing/power implementation results of hard (ASIC) components, FPGA fabric circuitry, and circuit modeling of 3D devices/packaging. It is part of the greater
RAD Flow, which is an open source academic architecture exploration and evaluation flow for novel beyond-FPGA reconfigurable accelerator devices (RADs).
Hard blocks may be network on chips (NoCs), tensor accelerators, or memory macros. RAD-Gen leverages the UC Berkeley `Hammer <https://hammer-vlsi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ framework to enable a PDK & Tool agnostic ASIC flow.

RAD-Gen is made up of three subtools: ASIC-DSE, COFFE, and IC-3D.

RAD-Gen is under heavy development.
