        This function runs HSPICE on the .sp file at 'sp_path' and returns a dictionary that 
        contains the HSPICE measurements.

        'parameter_dict' is a dictionary that contains the sizes of transistors and wire RC. 
        It has the following format:
        parameter_dict = {param1_name: [val1, val2, etc...],
                          param2_name: [val1, val2, etc...],
                          etc...}

        You need to make sure that 'parameter_dict' has a key-value pair for each parameter
        in your HSPICE netlists. Otherwise, the simulation will fail because of missing 
        parameters. That is, only the parameters found in 'parameter_dict' will be given a
        value. 
        
        This is important when we consider the fact that, the 'value' in the key value 
        pair is a list of different parameter values that you want to run HSPICE on.
        The lists must be of the same length for all params in 'parameter_dict' (param1_name's
        list has the same number of elements as param2_name). Here's what is going to happen:
        We will start by setting all the parameters to their 'val1' and we'll run HSPICE. 
        Then, we'll set all the params to 'val2' and we'll run HSPICE. And so on (that's 
        actually not exactly what happens, but you get the idea). So, you can run HSPICE on 
        different transistor size conbinations by adding elements to these lists. Transistor 
        sizing combination i is ALL the vali in the parameter_dict. So, even if you never 
        want to change param1_name, you still need a list (who's elements will all be the 
        same in this case).
        If you only want to run HSPICE for one transistor sizing combination, your lists will
        only have one element (but it still needs to be a list).

        Ok, so 'parameter_dict' contains a key-value pair for each transistor where the 'value'
        is a list of transistor sizes to use. A transistor sizing combination consists of all 
        the elements at a particular index in these lists. You also need to provide a key-value
        (or key-list we could say) for all your wire RC parameters. The wire RC data in the 
        lists corresponds to each transistor sizing combination. You'll need to calculate what
        the wire RC is for a particular transistor sizing combination outside this function 
        though. Here, we'll only set the paramters to the appropriate values. 

        Finally, what we'll return is a dictionary similar to 'parameter_dict' but containing
        all of the of the SPICE measurements. The return value will have this format: 

        measurements = {meas_name1: [value1, value2, value3, etc...], 
                        meas_name2: [value1, value2, value3, etc...],
